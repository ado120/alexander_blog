# ado_blog
This repo will house the code for my personal blog website!

## Questions
1. Should we use the CoreUi Bootstrap4 theme or go straight to CoreUI Vue?
2. Should we clone the CoreUI theme directory straight to the project?

## Design decisions
* Simple "Admin" Dashboard style blog website
  * Two elements. Main Page & Blog
    * Main Page contains site statistics/social media following tracker
    * Blog uses Jumbotron as the entries for the blog posts?


### To-Dos
1. Completely redo landing page (CHECK)
2. Uninstall all markdown packages and re-install a fresh one (CHECK)
3. Get highlightJS to work with the code (CHECK)
4. Get header to work, static?
5. Fix settings.py (CHECK)
6. Create working categories view
7. Why are icons blue, get new icons
8. Make reviews page
