# ado_blog
This repo will house the code for my personal blog website!

## Questions
1. Should we use the CoreUi Bootstrap4 theme or go straight to CoreUI Vue?
2. Should we clone the CoreUI theme directory straight to the project?

## Design decisions
* Simple "Admin" Dashboard style blog website
  * Two elements. Main Page & Blog
    * Main Page contains site statistics/social media following tracker
    * Blog uses Jumbotron as the entries for the blog posts?


### To-Dos
1. Fix footer (CHECK)
2. Create Basic Landing Page/Link to blog in navbar (JPEG picture is not working)
3. Post design
4. Implement text formatting for posts with code/links 
5. Syntax highlighting added, but need to fix display of it
6. Make categories have an href to all posts with that category
