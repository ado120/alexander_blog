This repo will house the code for my personal blog website!

## Questions
1. Should we use the CoreUi Bootstrap4 theme or go straight to CoreUI Vue?
2. Should we clone the CoreUI theme directory straight to the project?

## Design decisions
* Simple "Admin" Dashboard style blog website
  * Two elements. Main Page & Blog
    * Main Page contains site statistics/social media following tracker
    * Blog uses Jumbotron as the entries for the blog posts?


### To-Dos
1. Completely redo landing page (CHECK)
2. Uninstall all markdown packages and re-install a fresh one (CHECK)
3. Get highlightJS to work with the code (CHECK)
